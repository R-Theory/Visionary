# BMAD Documentation Checkpoints

## Purpose
Ensure BMAD methodology compliance at key milestones, maintaining alignment between implementation and documented agent constraints.

## Phase 0: Infrastructure & Safety - Checkpoint
**After Week 2 completion:**

### Agent Constraint Validation
- [ ] All agent database tables created per `docs/AGENTS.md` integration points
- [ ] Redis queues configured per event-driven architecture specification
- [ ] Circuit breaker thresholds match `docs/AGENTS.md` values
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented per agent specifications

### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Update `docs/AGENTS.md` if any constraint values changed during implementation
- [ ] Create ADR if significant infrastructure decisions were made
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with all agent-related configuration variables
- [ ] Verify `docs/BMAD_METHODOLOGY.md` Phase 0 completion criteria

### Agent Integration Test
- [ ] Media Processing Agent: Upload validation with constraint enforcement
- [ ] TTS Agent: Rate limiting and cache TTL verification
- [ ] Knowledge Ingestion Agent: Queue connectivity and timeout configuration
- [ ] All agents: Circuit breaker behavior under failure conditions

**BMAD Principle Check:** Does infrastructure support all 5 agents as specified in docs/AGENTS.md?

## Phase 1: Media Page MVP - Checkpoint  
**After Week 5 completion:**

### Agent Behavior Validation
- [ ] TTS Agent: 10 requests/minute rate limit enforced
- [ ] TTS Agent: 10,000 character text limit enforced  
- [ ] TTS Agent: 24-hour cache TTL working
- [ ] Media Agent: 100MB file size limit enforced
- [ ] Media Agent: MIME type validation (not just extension) working

### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Create `docs/adrs/001-pdf-js-integration.md` documenting shared worker decision
- [ ] Create `docs/adrs/002-tts-service-selection.md` if Speechify alternatives considered
- [ ] Update agent performance metrics in `docs/AGENTS.md` based on real usage
- [ ] Document any constraint adjustments needed (with justification)

### Feature Plan Completion
- [ ] Create `my-notes/Vision/05-Features/Media-Page-Feature-Plan.md` using template
- [ ] Validate all agent constraints are met in production deployment
- [ ] Update agent monitoring dashboards per `docs/AGENTS.md` specifications

**BMAD Principle Check:** Are Media and TTS agents operating within documented constraints?

---

## Phase 2: Knowledge Manager MVP - Checkpoint
**After Week 8 completion:**

### Agent Constraint Compliance
- [ ] Knowledge Ingestion Agent: 50MB document limit enforced
- [ ] Knowledge Ingestion Agent: 5-minute processing timeout working
- [ ] Knowledge Ingestion Agent: 800-character chunks with 120-character overlap
- [ ] AI Knowledge Worker: Processing quality meets 80% confidence threshold
- [ ] All agents: Event-driven communication working per architecture

### Documentation Updates Required  
- [ ] Create `docs/adrs/003-ai-model-selection.md` documenting model choice rationale
- [ ] Create `docs/adrs/004-knowledge-integration.md` documenting OpenWebUI integration approach
- [ ] Update `docs/AGENTS.md` with any constraint modifications discovered during testing
- [ ] Document agent performance metrics and optimization recommendations

### Knowledge Quality Validation
- [ ] AI processing accuracy meets agent specifications (80% confidence)
- [ ] Knowledge collections integrate properly with existing OpenWebUI search
- [ ] Agent error handling and circuit breakers tested under load
- [ ] Dead Letter Queue processing documented and tested

**BMAD Principle Check:** Do Knowledge and AI agents maintain quality and performance constraints?

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features - Checkpoint
**After Week 12 completion:**

### MCP Server Integration
- [ ] MCP tools follow agent constraint patterns from `docs/AGENTS.md`
- [ ] MCP tool security isolation implemented per agent security guidelines
- [ ] Tool discovery and registration follow agent communication patterns
- [ ] Permission management aligns with agent access control specifications

### Final Agent Validation
- [ ] All 5 agents operational within documented constraints
- [ ] Agent monitoring and observability per `docs/AGENTS.md` specifications
- [ ] Agent error handling and recovery tested and documented
- [ ] Agent performance metrics meet or exceed specifications

### Final Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `my-notes/Vision/06-Project/BMAD Applied.md` with completion status
- [ ] Create comprehensive `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with agent configuration guide
- [ ] Update all ADRs with final implementation decisions
- [ ] Create `docs/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md` for operations team

**Final BMAD Principle Check:** Complete methodology implementation with all agents documented, constrained, and observable?

## Emergency Procedures

### Agent Constraint Violation Response
1. Immediate: Disable violating agent via feature flag
2. Investigation: Check against `docs/AGENTS.md` specifications  
3. Fix: Implement constraint enforcement
4. Documentation: Update ADR with root cause and resolution
5. Prevention: Add monitoring alert for constraint violation

### Documentation Drift Response  
1. Identify: Compare implementation vs `docs/AGENTS.md`
2. Reconcile: Update documentation OR fix implementation
3. ADR: Document decision rationale
4. Communicate: Update team on constraint changes
