# BMAD Methodology Implementation

## Bootstrap-Model-Agent-Documentation for Visionary

This document outlines how the BMAD methodology is applied to the Visionary project development lifecycle.

## BMAD Overview

**BMAD** is a structured approach to AI-assisted software development that emphasizes:

- **Bootstrap**: Rapid project initialization with essential tooling
- **Model**: Clear data and behavioral models before implementation
- **Agent**: Autonomous AI agents with defined capabilities and constraints
- **Documentation**: Living documentation that drives development decisions

## Phase 1: Bootstrap âœ…

### Infrastructure Setup

- [x] Dev Container with VS Code extensions optimized for markdown and development
- [x] Git repository with conventional commits and automated hooks
- [x] Docker Compose stack for local development (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, monitoring)
- [x] Pre-commit hooks for code quality (markdownlint, prettier, security scans)
- [x] Task automation via `justfile` with 30+ development commands
- [x] Python environment with `uv` for fast dependency management

### Development Workflow

- [x] Obsidian vault for comprehensive planning and documentation
- [x] Quality gates: linting, formatting, security scanning
- [x] Error monitoring setup ready for integration
- [x] CI/CD preparation (GitHub Actions templates ready)

## Phase 2: Model âœ…

### Domain Models

**Media Management**
- File upload, validation, and storage coordination
- S3/MinIO integration with presigned URLs
- Metadata extraction and indexing
- Content type validation and size limits

**Knowledge Processing**
- Document ingestion and parsing (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
- Content chunking with configurable overlap
- Vector embedding generation and storage
- Semantic search and retrieval

**Text-to-Speech Pipeline**
- Content preprocessing and voice synthesis
- Caching layer with TTL management
- Audio streaming and delivery optimization
- Rate limiting and quota management

**Study Tools**
- Flashcard generation from processed content
- Quiz creation with adaptive difficulty
- Progress tracking and analytics
- AI-generated podcast scripts

### Data Architecture

```
PostgreSQL (Primary)
â”œâ”€â”€ media_files        # File metadata and references
â”œâ”€â”€ tts_cache         # Audio cache with expiration
â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge_chunks  # RAG vector storage
â”œâ”€â”€ job_status       # Background task tracking
â””â”€â”€ [study_sessions] # Study analytics (future)

S3/MinIO (Object Storage)
â”œâ”€â”€ visionary-media/     # User uploaded content
â””â”€â”€ visionary-tts-cache/ # Generated audio files

Redis (Cache & Queue)
â”œâ”€â”€ session_cache    # User sessions
â”œâ”€â”€ celery_queue    # Background jobs
â””â”€â”€ event_bus       # Agent communication
```

## Phase 3: Agent ðŸ”„

### Agent Architecture

Following the **Agent-Oriented Programming** paradigm:

1. **Autonomous**: Each agent operates independently within defined boundaries
2. **Reactive**: Responds to events and messages from other agents
3. **Proactive**: Takes initiative to achieve goals (e.g., cache cleanup)
4. **Social**: Communicates with other agents through well-defined protocols

### Core Agents

**Media Processing Agent**
- Handles file uploads and validation
- Coordinates with S3/MinIO storage
- Triggers downstream processing
- *Constraint: 100MB max file size, virus scanning required*

**TTS Agent**
- Synthesizes speech from text content
- Manages audio caching and delivery
- Implements rate limiting per user
- *Constraint: 10K chars max, 10 req/min rate limit*

**Knowledge Ingestion Agent**
- Extracts text from documents
- Generates embeddings for vector search
- Manages chunking strategies
- *Constraint: 5min processing timeout, 50MB max doc*

**Study Content Agent**
- Generates flashcards and quizzes
- Tracks learning progress
- Creates AI podcast content
- *Constraint: 80% confidence threshold for content*

**Email Integration Agent**
- Connects with email providers (Gmail, Outlook)
- AI-powered classification and summarization
- Smart folder organization
- *Constraint: Read-only access, OAuth2 required*

### Agent Communication

**Event-Driven Messaging**: Redis pub/sub channels for loose coupling
```
events/media/uploaded -> Knowledge Agent + Study Agent
events/tts/requested -> TTS Agent
events/document/processed -> Frontend notification
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Graceful degradation when external services fail
**Dead Letter Queues**: Failed event recovery and monitoring

## Phase 4: Documentation ðŸ“š

### Living Documentation Strategy

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
- Document key technical decisions with context and consequences
- Version controlled alongside code
- Referenced in agent specifications

**API-First Development**
- OpenAPI specifications drive development
- Auto-generated client libraries
- Contract testing between agents

**Runbook Documentation**
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Incident response playbooks
- Performance tuning guides

### Documentation Automation

**Code-Generated Docs**
- API documentation from OpenAPI specs
- Agent behavior from code annotations
- Database schema from migrations

**Continuous Documentation**
- Updates triggered by code changes
- Validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Broken link detection and repair

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps (M1-M2)

1. **Fork OpenWebUI** and integrate Visionary documentation
2. **Implement Media Agent** with S3 presigned URL generation
3. **Create PDF Viewer** with per-page TTS integration
4. **Deploy Docker stack** to staging environment

### Short Term (M3-M4)

1. **Background TTS Jobs** with Celery worker implementation
2. **Knowledge Ingestion** pipeline with vector embeddings
3. **Comprehensive Testing** (unit, integration, E2E with Playwright)
4. **Monitoring & Alerting** with Prometheus + Grafana

### Medium Term (M5+)

1. **Study Page** with flashcards and AI podcast generation
2. **Email Manager** with provider integrations
3. **Advanced Analytics** and user behavior tracking
4. **Mobile Optimization** and PWA capabilities

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- Feature delivery time: Target 2-week cycles
- Bug resolution time: <24 hours for critical, <1 week for standard
- Code review turnaround: <48 hours

### System Performance
- API response time: <200ms p95
- File upload success rate: >99.9%
- TTS cache hit rate: >80%
- Search relevance: >85% user satisfaction

### Quality Gates
- Test coverage: >80% for agents, >90% for core business logic
- Security scan: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance: No regression in load test benchmarks
- Documentation: All public APIs documented with examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **External API Dependencies**: Circuit breakers + fallback strategies
- **Scale Limitations**: Horizontal scaling design from start
- **Data Loss**: Multi-region backups + point-in-time recovery

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict milestone definitions + regular reviews
- **Knowledge Silos**: Pair programming + documentation requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring sprints + code quality metrics
